# Introduction

This is a calculator on the web built using vanilla JavaScript. It should behave the same way a normal calculator would, allowing users to evaluate basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), be it a single operation, e.g. 1 + 1 = 2, or a sequence of chained operations, e.g. 3 + 5 * 4 / 2 = 16 (there's no order of precedence between operators so expressions are always evaluated left to right).
